## Notes

One of the main challenges I encountered while working on this project was my limited familiarity with JavaScript and DOM manipulation. As a result, implementing interactivity, such as dynamically displaying only funded or unfunded games and updating page elements based on user actions, required significant effort. I had to spend additional time understanding how to select, modify, and append elements in the DOM, as well as learning how event listeners work to make the buttons functional. While this was initially overwhelming, it provided an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and improve my skills in web development.
